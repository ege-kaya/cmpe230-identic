# Duplicate Finder

A Python program that serves to identify duplicate files and directories. It can be invoked with the following options and arguments:

`identic [-f | -d ] [-c] [-n] [-s] [\<dir1\> \<dir2\> ... ]`
  
The identic program will traverse the directories and look for files or directories that are
duplicates of each other. The full pathnames of duplicates will be printed as output.
  
`[-f | -d ]`: `-f` means look for identical files, `-d` means look for identical
directories. The default is identical files.

`-c`: Identical will mean the contents are exactly the same (note
that the names can be different).

`-n`: Identical will mean the directory/file names are exactly the
same (note that the contents can be different).

`-cn`: Identical will mean both the contents and the directory/file
names are exactly the same.

`[\<dir1\> \<dir2\> ... ]`: The list of directories to traverse (note that the directories
will be traversed recursively, i.e. directories and their
subdirectories and their subdirectories etc. etc.). The
default is current directory.
  
`-s`: The size for each duplicate will also be printed. The
duplicates should be printed in descending order of size.
This option is ignored when `â€“n` option is used.
